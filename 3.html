  <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">JavaScript</a> is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
  <strong>1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</strong>
   Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.
   Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB,
   also use JavaScript as their programming language.

   both in concept and design.</p>

   and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
   ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript
   is the official name of the language.
